# hennge-golang-test
Developer test for HENNGE. Made in Golang.

## Description
 * We want you to calculate the sum of squares of given integers, excluding any negatives.
 * The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), indicating the number of test cases to follow.
 * Each of the test cases will consist of a line with an integer X (0 < X <= 100), followed by another line consisting of X number of space-separated integers Yn (-100 <= Yn <= 100).
 * For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers, excluding any negatives, and print the calculated sum in the output.
 * __Note__: There should be no output until all the input has been received.
 * __Note 2__: Do not put blank lines between test cases solutions.
 * __Note 3__: Take input from standard input, and output to standard output.
## Rules
 * Write your solution using Go Programming Language
 * Your source code must be a single file (`package main`)
 * Do not use any `for` statement
 * You may only use standard library packages
